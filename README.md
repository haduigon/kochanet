**Kochanet**

# _Description:_

It is a test task. Simply todo app with free api, login and registration via Firebase. Styles done with Tailwind only. I think Tailwind is a reincarnation af a Bootstrap. Or a younger sibling. I used the react-query, it`s quite nice and usefull. I also used react-router and react-context. Created a few customHooks.

# Reflection

I have tried to follow all the requirement but to meet the deadline

I did not keep the url params after page renew

I hardcoded id and userId when adding new post, as far as I know length of whole array is 100 elems and it is only for 60 sec, real data dont changes, so after refresh data will be the same

I did not add the firebase register via ggl / fb / gth beacause de facto it is the same with login via socials network, in both cases acc is created, difference is mostly in the customer flow, so to save time, i skipped

I followed this simple design to meet deadlines

I know you like details but i did not manage to do them all in this deadline but tried to do my best

It was very interesting two days with react-query.

Main mistakes / disadvantages are bellow : 

Design is very simple, validation is madden very commonly, not customized, not bestvoptimization probably, issues with naming, etc.

So, thank you a lot, keep in touch )
